Custom User Model with ViewSets and SimpleJWT Integration

This project features a custom user model, allowing for more flexibility in user management. Viewsets from Django REST Framework are utilized to efficiently manage API endpoints, while SimpleJWT handles authentication through JWT tokens. This integration ensures secure access to the API, with viewsets streamlining CRUD operations into a single class. JWT authentication and custom permissions safeguard the endpoints, tailored to the specific needs of the custom user model.
